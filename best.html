          Probably the best book to read. Harry Potter is a series of seven
          fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels
          chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends
          Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts
          School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's
          struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become
          immortal, overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of
          Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).Since
          the release of the first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's
          Stone, on 26 June 1997, the books have found immense popularity,
          positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide. They have
          attracted a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and are
          often considered cornerstones of modern young adult literature. As of
          February 2018, the books have sold more than 500 million copies
          worldwide, making them the best-selling book series in history, and
          have been translated into eighty languages. The last four books
          consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history,
          with the final instalment selling roughly eleven million copies in the
          United States within twenty-four hours of its release.

          years, so what list wouldn’t include A Game of Thrones? If you like
          multiple, intricate story lines, a cast of characters where none is
          safe from death, and a world full of lords, knights, bastards,
          wizards, ladies, and more, then you’ll like this series. It has magic,
          intrigue, mystery, and lots of romance; in essence, a world unlike any
          you’ve ever encountered.
